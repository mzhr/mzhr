- 👋 Hi, I’m @mzhr
- 👀 I’m interested in ... (Mobile Development, here are some Recommendations)
  - Framework: React Native, stable and standard, typescript, can onboard web developers at ease, easy to extend
  - Navigation: React Navigation works great enough 🙂
  - State Management: Still investgating but best experience has been mobx-state-tree following by redux-tool-kit, usually opt for context
  - Forms: react-hook-forms although if on Zustrand, benefit isn't worth the transition
  - UI: css-in-js for RN is not useful when StyleSheet exists, although react-native-paper is great to get up and running
  - Native&Others: react-native-bootsplash, react-native-community packages, rea
  - Cloud: Firebase when working solo, AWS Amplify (doesn't have great typescript integration) when working with a smart team
  - Animations: Investigating..., lottie for cool stuff
  - API: axios for rest, investigating best graphql solution
  - OTA: Expo works great to get up and running, code push for native
  - CI/CD: Bitrise has a great GUI dashboard, Azure, AppCenter, Github Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines all work nicely
  - Workflow: Gitflow for bigger teams, must have great lint setup, helping team and code reviews should be a priority
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... (AWS and becoming an expert in mobile space)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (projects that benefit the ummah)
- 📫 How to reach me ... (contact me at my email 🙂)
